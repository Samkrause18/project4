        <p style="font-size: 16pt;">Printing the Hand</p> 
        <p> To begin this process we started by printing all the pieces. This proved to be not that difficult, but rather lengthy as some of the prints took more than 3 hours each.  We were able to combine some of the files onto one build plate which reduced the time needed and was far more efficient. In order to finish all the prints we had to come in for office hours, and there we were easily able to pick up our completed prints and continue on to the construction.

        <p> In order to design a modification to the e-NABLE hand, I thought of activities I do throughout the week. One such activity was cycling, in which the user needs to be able to firmly grasp the handle bars. To solve this issue I thought a hook would be good since it would be able to grasp on, but also be able permit the rider to detach with ease. I do not think this first design would work because there are many more variables to think about, such as grip and length of the hook. I feel this design is important because it opens up regular activities and allows for a more fun and functional life to be lived. Furthermore a hook design for cycling could benefit other activities such as weight lifting which brings back the idea of constraints from the Design toolkit reading which mentions how design can benefit a wider range of people that it may not had been thinking of originally.

        <p style="font-size: 16pt ">Building the Hand</p>
        <p> The building of the hand proved to be more difficult than I anticipated. The video instructions we used were hard to follow and unclear. To aid with the confusion we referenced an already completed build, which made the process easier. Once we had all the parts connected we had to assemble the rubber bands and string so that the hand would function. I found this the most difficult because the string and rubber bands were so tiny and the string needed to be knotted tightly around very tight spaces. Once fully assembled however, we had a fully functioning e-NABLE hand.
